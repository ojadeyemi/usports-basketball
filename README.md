## Usage

- ### Fetching current stats from the league

```python
from usports_basketball import usport_team_stats, usports_player_stats

# Fetching and processing men's team statistics
men_team_stats_df = usport_team_stats('m')

# Fetching and processing men's player statistics
men_player_stats_df = usport_players_stats('m')

# Fetch statistics for women's playoff teams
women_team_stats_df = usport_team_stats('w', 'playoffs')

# Fetch statistics for women's players playing in U Sports championship Final 8
women_player_stats_df = usport_players_stats('w', 'championship')
```

- ### Viewing Column Names

```python
# Use these code snippets to see all column names in each DataFrame
# For the team statistics DataFrame
print("Column names in men's player statistics DataFrame:")
print(men_player_stats_df.columns.tolist())

# For the player statistics DataFrame
print("\nColumn names in men's player statistics DataFrame:")
print(men_player_stats_df.columns.tolist())
```

- ### Exporting DataFrame to different files

```python
# Export the  to a CSV file using the `to_csv()` method
men_team_stats_df.to_csv('men_team_stats.csv', index=False)  # Export without row index

#Export to a HTML table representation using to_html method
men_team_stats_df.to_html('table.html')

#Export to a JSON file using the to_json() method
men_team_stats_df.to_json('men_team_stats.json', orient='records') # Export in 'records' format

#Export to a SQLite database using the to_sql() method (requires SQLAlchemy)
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///usports_stats.db') #Export to SQLite database
women_team_stats_df.to_sql('team_stats', con=engine, index=False) # Export without row index
women_player_stats_df.to_sql('player_stats', con=engine, index=False) # Export without row index
```
